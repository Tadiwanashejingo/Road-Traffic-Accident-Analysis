## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project are to:
- Analyze **driver and victim demographics**
- Study the impact of **weather and environmental conditions**
- Examine **vehicle types and vehicle conditions**
- Identify **root causes of road accidents**
- Understand **time-based trends** (daily, monthly, yearly patterns)

---

## 🧠 Methodology
The project applies the following data science techniques:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive & summary statistics
- Correlation and covariance analysis
- Outlier detection
- Supervised machine learning models (basic implementation)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain age groups and vehicle categories are more prone to accidents
- Weather conditions significantly influence accident severity
- Peak accident times align with traffic congestion hours
- Specific accident causes occur repeatedly across regions and time periods
