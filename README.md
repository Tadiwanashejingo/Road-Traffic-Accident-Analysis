# Road-Traffic-Accident-Analysis
The Road Traffic Accident Analysis project is a data science initiative that explores patterns, causes, and contributing factors behind road accidents using Python. It focuses on five key objectives: analyzing the demographics of drivers and victims, assessing the impact of weather and environmental conditions, examining vehicle types and their conditions, identifying root causes of accidents, and understanding temporal distribution patterns. Through techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), summary statistics, correlation and covariance analysis, outlier detection, and supervised machine learning, the project uncovers valuable insights that can inform road safety policies and prevention strategies. The analysis is implemented using Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebooks.
